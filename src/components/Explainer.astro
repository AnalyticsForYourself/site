            <p><strong>What is this?</strong> AnalyticsForYourself is a small indie project designed to help give fan fic authors a better idea of how people interact with their works.</p>

            <p>The <abbr title="Analytics For Yourself">AFY</abbr> team believes that AO3 should be an archive first. This means keeping costs minimal, teams small, and focusing on doing what they do best, preserving fan works for future generations.</p>

            <h3>Minimal impact, maximum outcome</h3>
            <p>Most analytics services are greedy, taking as much information as they can. We don't. When you sign up for AFY, we look through your list of works and save the statistics that are visible. We don't look again for another 24 hours.</p>

            <h3>Privacy minded, for you and your readers</h3>
            <p>We only track statistics relevant to your work. That's how many people have left a kudo, a comment, a bookmark, or looked at your work. We never know the "who" of any of those statistics. Only the "what".</p>
