            <h3>The analytics AO3 deserves, but shouldn't have to provide.</h3>
            <p>The <abbr title="Analytics For Yourself">AFY</abbr> team believes that AO3 should be an archive first. That means focusing on preserving fan works, not refining how they track views.</p>

            <h3>Minimal impact, maximum outcome</h3>
            <p>Most analytics services are greedy, taking as much information as they can. We don't. When you sign up for AFY, we only save what is relevant to your writing.</p>

        <p>We do the utmost possible to limit the resources we use, this means storing only the data we need and serving energy and storage efficent web pages. That makes pricing a breeze. For just $PRICING a month, we can cover all of a user's costs, and anything left over is donated directly to OTW.</p>
